Problem:
  Write and test a program that computes the area of a circle. This program should request a number representing a radius as input from the user. It should use the formula 3.14 * radius ** 2 to compute the area and then output this result suitably labeled.
Solution:
   
"""
radius = int(input("Enter with radius: "))
area = 3.14 * radius ** 2
print("The area is",area,"circle units")
