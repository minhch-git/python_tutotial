Problem:
  Enter an input statement using the input function at the shell prompt. When the prompt asks you for input, enter a number. Then, attempt to add 1 to that number, observe the results, and explain what happened.
Solution:
"""

# input() // 8 
# -> result = '8'
# The results is string. Because: The default return type of input is string if no other data type is assigned to it
