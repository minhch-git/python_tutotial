Problem:
    The Payroll Department keeps a list of employee information for each pay period in a text file.
    The format of each line of the file is the following:
    <last name> <hourly wage> <hours worked>
    Write a program that inputs a file_name from the user and
    prints to the terminal a report of the wages paid to the employees for the given period. 
    The report should be in tabular format with the appropriate header. 
    Each line should contain an employeeâ€™s name, the hours worked, and the wages paid for that period.
Solution:
    
"""
# Take the inputs
file_name = input("Enter the file name: ")

# Open the input file 
input_file = open(file_name, 'r')

# Read the data and print the report
print("%-15s%6s%15s" % ("Name", "Hours", "Total Pay"))
for line in input_file:
    dataList = line.split()
    name = dataList[0]
    hours = int(dataList[1])
    payRate = float(dataList[2])
    totalPay = hours * payRate
    print("%-15s%6s%15s" % (name, hours, totalPay))
