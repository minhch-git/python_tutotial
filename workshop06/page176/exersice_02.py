Problem:
    Describe the processes of top-down design and stepwise refinement.
    Where does the design start, and how does it proceed?
Solution:
    A top-down approach (also known as stepwise design) is essentially 
    the breaking down of a system to gain insight into the sub-systems that make it up.
    In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated,
    specifying but not detailing any first-level subsystems. 
    Each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail, 
    sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, 
    until the entire specification is reduced to base elements.
    Once these base elements are recognised then we can build these as computer modules.
    Once they are built we can put them together, making the entire system from these individual components.
