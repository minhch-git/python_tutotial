Problem:
    In what way is a recursive design different from top-down design?
Solution:
    Recursive functions are a type of functions in which the same function it called itself in the body of the function.
    A recursion should have a base case and an iteration case. 
    The base case is the termination point at which the program should halt.

    The top-down consists in solving the problem in a "natural manner" and 
    check if you have calculated the solution to the subproblem before.
