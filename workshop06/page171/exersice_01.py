Problem:
    Anne complains that defining functions to use in her programs is a lot of extra work.
    She says she can finish her programs much more quickly 
    if she just writes them using the basic operators and control statements.
    State three reasons why her view is shortsighted.
Solution:
    Hard to test, because it depends on the state of the application. (Organization)
    It makes the code harder to read and understand.
    Inability to reuse code, repetitive code
