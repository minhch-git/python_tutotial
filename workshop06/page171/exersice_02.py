Problem:
    Explain how an algorithm solves a general class of problems and 
    how a function definition can support this property of an algorithm.
Solution:
    An algorithm is a general method for solving a class of problems. 
    The individual problems that make up a class of problems are known as problem instances. 

    Example:
        def summation(a, b):
            return a + b
        summation(8,8)
    The summation function contains both the code for the summation algorithm and 
    themeans of supplying problem instances to this algorithm. 
    The problem instances are the data sent as arguments to the function.
    The parameters or argument names in the functionâ€™s header behave like variables waiting to be assigned data whenever the function is called.
