Problem:
  1. Write the outputs of the following loops:
    a. for count in range(5):
    print(count + 1, end = " ")
    b. for count in range(1, 4):
    print(count, end = " ")
    c. for count in range(1, 6, 2):
    print(count, end = " ")
    d. for count in range(6, 1, â€“1):
    print(count, end = " ")

Solution:
  
"""
for count in range(5):
  print(count + 1, end = " ")

for count in range(1, 4):
  print(count, end = " ")

for count in range(1, 6, 2):
  print(count, end = " ")

for count in range(6, 1, -1):
  print(count, end = " ")
