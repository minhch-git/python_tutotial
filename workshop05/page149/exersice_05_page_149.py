Problem:
  What is the purpose of a main function?
  
Solution:
  The main function serves as the starting point for program execution. 
  It usually controls program execution by directing the calls to other functions in the program.
  A program usually stops executing at the end of main,
  although it can terminate at other points in the program for a variety of reasons.
