Problem:
  Write a loop that replaces each number in a list named data with its absolute value.
Solution:
  Aliasing can make the different signals for becoming in-distinguishable from one another.

  Aliasing can be reduced with the help of sampling, 
  which is done at a higher rate than that of the Nyquist rate.

  Anti-aliasing technique is being used for eliminating 
  the effect of overlaping of the frequency components.
