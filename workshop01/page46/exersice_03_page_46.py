Problem:
  How does one include an apostrophe as a character within a string literal?
  
Solution:
  1. Using double quotes to enclose
    Example: "i don't like it."
  2. Using escape Sequences: \'
    Example: 
      'i don't like it.'
      "I don\'t like it."

"""
print("I don't like it.")
print('I don\'t like it.')
print("I don\'t like it.")
