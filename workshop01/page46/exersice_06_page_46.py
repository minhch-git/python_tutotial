Problem:
  List two of the purposes of program documentation.
  
Solution:
  In a program, good documentation can be as important as executable code. Ideally, program code is self-documenting, so a human reader can instantly understand it.
  Help orient a programmer called on to modify the program at some future date.
  Explain the workings of complex or tricky sections of code.
